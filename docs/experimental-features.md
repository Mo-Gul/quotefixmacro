# Experimental Features

## QuoteColorizer

QuoteColorizer colorizes the indented parts in different colors to make it easier to distinguish who wrote which text. Set `USE_COLORIZER` to `True` to use this. The mail format is automatically set to Rich-Text.

The recipient will receive the colors, too.
In case, you don't want this, enable convert RTF-to-Text at sending.

This feature is currently not working.
Discussions is made available at [#18](https://github.com/macros4outlook/quotefixmacro/issues/18).
