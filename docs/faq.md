Q: What if the whole mail text disappears?
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD038 -->
A: The reply setting in Outlook is not configured as required. Double check that the original text should be prefixed with `> `.

Q: How to sign the macro?  
A With Outlook 2016, this doesn't seem to be necessary any more since self-written macros seem to be usable without error.
Otherwise, following article should explain everything: <https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-self-signed-digital-certificate-microsoft-office-2016/>.
There is also an [MSN Article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/office-xp/aa163622(v=office.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) on macro code signing for Office XP.
